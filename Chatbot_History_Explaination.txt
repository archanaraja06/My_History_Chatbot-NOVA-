1. Importing Libraries

Imports all the necessary modules like Flask, os, dotenv, and google.genai.

These help in creating the web app, connecting to Gemini, and loading environment variables.

2. Loading Environment Variables

load_dotenv() loads secret data from the .env file.

This keeps your API key safe and hidden from your code.

3. Creating the Flask App

app = Flask(__name__) starts a new Flask web application.

Flask handles the backend (server) part of the chatbot.

4. Getting the Gemini API Key

os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY") fetches the API key from .env.

Without this key, the program can’t connect to Google’s Gemini AI.

5. Checking for Missing API Key

If the API key is not found, the code prints an error and exits.

This prevents the app from running without proper setup.

6. Connecting to Gemini

client = genai.Client(api_key=API_KEY) connects the Flask app to Gemini AI.

model_name = "gemini-2.5-flash" selects the specific Gemini model to use.

7. Setting System Instructions

Defines how the chatbot should behave (friendly, short, and in bullet points).

Helps maintain a consistent and structured response style.

8. Creating a Chat Session

Starts a new chat session with Gemini using the model and system instructions.

This session remembers the context of the conversation.

9.Home Route (Frontend Display)

@app.route('/') loads the index.html file from the templates folder.

This is the main chatbot interface the user interacts with.

10. Chat Route (Backend Communication)

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST']) handles messages from the user.

Takes the user’s input, sends it to Gemini, and returns the AI’s response as JSON.

11. Error Handling

If any issue occurs (like API error), it catches the exception.

Sends a simple error message back instead of crashing the app.

12. Running the App

app.run(debug=True) starts the chatbot server locally.

debug=True helps identify errors during development.
